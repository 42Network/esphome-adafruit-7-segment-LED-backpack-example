# esphome-adafruit-7-segment-LED-backpack-example

Control the Adafruit 7-Segment Display Backpack (ht16k33) directly from lambdas within espHome nodemcu configuration files.
To do so you must include the Adafruit Backpack Library code in your /config/esphome directory.  See comments in the yaml file.

The example gets the time from HASS each minute and temperature/humidity data whenever it changes.  All data is displayed.

You may use this code however you want.  No license is necessary.  The whole effort was just for the sake of learning.

All my appreciation and admiration goes to Otto Winter for creating and supporting espHome for Home Assistant.
